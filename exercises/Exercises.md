['subtle', 'sets', 't set', 'site']
```

**13)** Can you reason out why this code results in the output shown? The aim was to remove all `<characters>` patterns but not the `<>` ones. The expected result was `'a 1<> b 2<> c'`.

```ruby
>>> ip = 'a<apple> 1<> b<bye> 2<> c<cat>'

>>> re.sub(r'<.+?>', '', ip)
'a 1 2'

[('1.32', '-3.14'), ('634', '5.63'), ('63.3e3', '9907809345343.235')]
```

**10)** This is an extension to the previous question.

* For `row1`, find the sum of integers of each tuple element. For example, sum of `-2` and `5` is `3`.
* For `row2`, find the sum of floating-point numbers of each tuple element. For example, sum of `1.32` and `-3.14` is `-1.82`.

```ruby
>>> row1 = '-2,5 4,+3 +42,-53 4356246,-357532354 '
>>> row2 = '1.32,-3.14 634,5.63 63.3e3,9907809345343.235 '

# should be the same as previous question
>>> pat = re.compile()       ##### add your solution here

##### add your solution here for row1
[3, 7, -11, -353176108]

##### add your solution here for row2
[-1.82, 639.63, 9907809408643.234]
```

**11)** Use `re.split()` to get the output as shown below.

>>> re.split()        ##### add your solution here
['42', 'output', '1000', 'tr:u-ck', 'SQEX49801']
```

**12)** For the given list of strings, change the elements into a tuple of original element and the number of times `t` occurs in that element.

```ruby
>>> words = ['sequoia', 'attest', 'tattletale', 'asset']

##### add your solution here
[('sequoia', 0), ('attest', 3), ('tattletale', 4), ('asset', 1)]
```

**13)** The given input string has fields separated by `:`. Each field contains four uppercase alphabets followed optionally by two digits. Ignore the last field, which is empty. See [docs.python: Match.groups](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.Match.groups) and use `re.finditer()` to get the output as shown below. If the optional digits aren't present, show `'NA'` instead of `None`.

```ruby
>>> ip = 'TWXA42:JWPA:NTED01:'

##### add your solution here
[('TWXA', '42'), ('JWPA', 'NA'), ('NTED', '01')]
```

>![info](../images/info.svg) Note that this is different from `re.findall()` which will just give empty string instead of `None` when a capture group doesn't participate.

**14)** Convert the comma separated strings to corresponding `dict` objects as shown below.

```ruby
>>> row1 = 'name:rohan,maths:75,phy:89,'

['128A', '0xfe32', '34']

##### add your solution here for str2
['0XDEADBEEF', '0x0ff1ce', 'bad']
```

**6)** Delete from `(` to the next occurrence of `)` unless they contain parentheses characters in between.

```ruby
>>> str1 = 'def factorial()'
>>> str2 = 'a/b(division) + c%d(#modulo) - (e+(j/k-3)*4)'
>>> str3 = 'Hi there(greeting). Nice day(a(b)'

>>> remove_parentheses = re.compile()      ##### add your solution here

>>> remove_parentheses.sub('', str1)
'def factorial'
>>> remove_parentheses.sub('', str2)
'a/b + c%d - (e+*4)'
>>> remove_parentheses.sub('', str3)
'Hi there. Nice day(a'
```

**7)** For the list `words`, filter all elements not starting with `e` or `p` or `u`.

```ruby
>>> words = ['surrender', 'unicorn', 'newer', 'door', 'empty', 'eel', '(pest)']

##### add your solution here
['surrender', 'newer', 'door', '(pest)']
```

**8)** For the list `words`, filter all elements not containing `u` or `w` or `ee` or `-`.

```ruby
>>> words = ['p-t', 'you', 'tea', 'heel', 'owe', 'new', 'reed', 'ear']

##### add your solution here
['tea', 'ear']
```

**9)** The given input strings contain fields separated by `,` and fields can be empty too. Replace the last three fields with `WHTSZ323`.

```ruby
>>> row1 = '(2),kite,12,,D,C,,'
>>> row2 = 'hi,bye,sun,moon'

>>> pat = re.compile()      ##### add your solution here

>>> pat.sub()       ##### add your solution here for row1
'(2),kite,12,,D,WHTSZ323'
>>> pat.sub()       ##### add your solution here for row2
'hi,WHTSZ323'
```

**10)** Split the given strings based on consecutive sequence of digit or whitespace characters.

```ruby
>>> str1 = 'lion \t Ink32onion Nice'
>>> str2 = '**1\f2\n3star\t7 77\r**'

>>> pat = re.compile()       ##### add your solution here

>>> pat.split(str1)
['lion', 'Ink', 'onion', 'Nice']
>>> pat.split(str2)
['**', 'star', '**']
```

**11)** Delete all occurrences of the sequence `<characters>` where `characters` is one or more non `>` characters and cannot be empty.

```ruby
>>> ip = 'a<ap\nple> 1<> b<bye> 2<> c<cat>'

##### add your solution here
'a 1<> b 2<> c'
```

**12)** `\b[a-z](on|no)[a-z]\b` is same as `\b[a-z][on]{2}[a-z]\b`. True or False? Sample input lines shown below might help to understand the differences, if any.

```ruby
>>> print('known\nmood\nknow\npony\ninns')
known
mood
know
pony
inns
```

**13)** For the given list, filter all elements containing any number sequence greater than `624`.

```ruby
>>> items = ['hi0000432abcd', 'car00625', '42_624 0512', '3.14 96 2 foo1234baz']

##### add your solution here
['car00625', '3.14 96 2 foo1234baz']
```

**14)** Count the maximum depth of nested braces for the given strings. Unbalanced or wrongly ordered braces should return `-1`. Note that this will require a mix of regular expressions and Python code.

```ruby
>>> def max_nested_braces(ip):
##### add your solution here

>>> max_nested_braces('a*b')
0
>>> max_nested_braces('}a+b{')
-1
>>> max_nested_braces('a*b+{}')
1
>>> max_nested_braces('{{a+2}*{b+c}+e}')
2
>>> max_nested_braces('{{a+2}*{b+{c*d}}+e}')
3
>>> max_nested_braces('{{a+2}*{\n{b+{c*d}}+e*d}}')
4
>>> max_nested_braces('a*{b+c*{e*3.14}}}')
-1
```

**15)** By default, the `str.split()` method will split on whitespace and remove empty strings from the result. Which `re` module function would you use to replicate this functionality?

```ruby
>>> ip = ' \t\r  so  pole\t\t\t\n\nlit in to \r\n\v\f  '

>>> ip.split()
['so', 'pole', 'lit', 'in', 'to']
##### add your solution here
['so', 'pole', 'lit', 'in', 'to']
```

**16)** Convert the given input string to two different lists as shown below.

```ruby
>>> ip = 'price_42 roast^\t\n^-ice==cat\neast'

##### add your solution here
['price_42', 'roast', 'ice', 'cat', 'east']

##### add your solution here
['price_42', ' ', 'roast', '^\t\n^-', 'ice', '==', 'cat', '\n', 'east']
```

**17)** Filter all whole elements with optional whitespaces at the start followed by three to five non-digit characters. Whitespaces at the start should not be part of the calculation for non-digit characters.

```ruby
>>> items = ['\t \ncat', 'goal', ' oh', 'he-he', 'goal2', 'ok ', 'sparrow']

##### add your solution here
['\t \ncat', 'goal', 'he-he', 'ok ']
```

<br>

# Groupings and backreferences

**1)** Replace the space character that occurs after a word ending with `a` or `r` with a newline character.

>>> print(re.sub())      ##### add your solution here
area
not a
_a2_ roar
took 22
```

##### add your solution here
'sequoia [subtle] exhibit asset [sets2] tests [si_te]'
```

**3)** Replace all whole words with `X` that start and end with the same word character (irrespective of case). Single character word should get replaced with `X` too, as it satisfies the stated condition.

```ruby
>>> ip = 'oreo not a _a2_ Roar took 22'

##### add your solution here
'X not X X X took X'
```

**4)** Convert the given *markdown* headers to corresponding *anchor* tags. Consider the input to start with one or more `#` characters followed by space and word characters. The `name` attribute is constructed by converting the header to lowercase and replacing spaces with hyphens. Can you do it without using a capture group?

```ruby
>>> header1 = '# Regular Expressions'
>>> header2 = '## Compiling regular expressions'

##### add your solution here for header1
'# <a name="regular-expressions"></a>Regular Expressions'
##### add your solution here for header2
'## <a name="compiling-regular-expressions"></a>Compiling regular expressions'
```

**5)** Convert the given *markdown* anchors to corresponding *hyperlinks*.

'[Regular Expressions](#regular-expressions)'
##### add your solution here for anchor2
'[Subexpression calls](#subexpression-calls)'
```

**6)** Count the number of whole words that have at least two occurrences of consecutive repeated alphabets. For example, words like `stillness` and `Committee` should be counted but not words like `root` or `readable` or `rotational`.

```ruby

... carelessness committed apparition innkeeper
... occasionally afforded embarrassment foolishness
... depended successfully succeeded
... possession cleanliness suppress'''

##### add your solution here
13
```

**7)** For the given input string, replace all occurrences of digit sequences with only the unique non-repeating sequence. For example, `232323` should be changed to `23` and `897897` should be changed to `897`. If there are no repeats (for example `1234`) or if the repeats end prematurely (for example `12121`), it should not be changed.

```ruby
>>> ip = '1234 2323 453545354535 9339 11 60260260'

##### add your solution here
'1234 23 4535 9339 1 60260260'
```

**8)** Replace sequences made up of words separated by `:` or `.` by the first word of the sequence. Such sequences will end when `:` or `.` is not followed by a word character.

##### add your solution here
'wow hi-2 bye kite'
```

**9)** Replace sequences made up of words separated by `:` or `.` by the last word of the sequence. Such sequences will end when `:` or `.` is not followed by a word character.

##### add your solution here
'five hi-2 bye water'
```

**10)** Split the given input string on one or more repeated sequence of `cat`.

```ruby
>>> ip = 'firecatlioncatcatcatbearcatcatparrot'

##### add your solution here
['fire', 'lion', 'bear', 'parrot']
```

**11)** For the given input string, find all occurrences of digit sequences with at least one repeating sequence. For example, `232323` and `897897`. If the repeats end prematurely, for example `12121`, it should not be matched.

```ruby
>>> ip = '1234 2323 453545354535 9339 11 60260260'

>>> pat = re.compile()      ##### add your solution here

# entire sequences in the output
##### add your solution here
['2323', '453545354535', '11']

# only the unique sequence in the output
##### add your solution here
['23', '4535', '1']
```

**12)** Convert the comma separated strings to corresponding `dict` objects as shown below. The keys are `name`, `maths` and `phy` for the three fields in the input strings.

```ruby
>>> row1 = 'rohan,75,89'
>>> row2 = 'rose,88,92'

>>> pat = re.compile()      ##### add your solution here

##### add your solution here for row1
{'name': 'rohan', 'maths': '75', 'phy': '89'}
##### add your solution here for row2
{'name': 'rose', 'maths': '88', 'phy': '92'}
```

**13)** Surround all whole words with `()`. Additionally, if the whole word is `imp` or `ant`, delete them. Can you do it with just a single substitution?

```ruby
>>> ip = 'tiger imp goat eagle ant important'

##### add your solution here
'(tiger) () (goat) (eagle) () (important)'
```

**14)** Filter all elements that contain a sequence of lowercase alphabets followed by `-` followed by digits. They can be optionally surrounded by `{{` and `}}`. Any partial match shouldn't be part of the output.

```ruby
>>> ip = ['{{apple-150}}', '{{mango2-100}}', '{{cherry-200', 'grape-87']

##### add your solution here
['{{apple-150}}', 'grape-87']
```

**15)** The given input string has sequences made up of words separated by `:` or `.` and such sequences will end when `:` or `.` is not followed by a word character. For all such sequences, display only the last word followed by `-` followed by the first word.

```ruby
>>> ip = 'wow:Good:2_two.five: hi-2 bye kite.777:water.'

##### add your solution here
['five-wow', 'water-kite']
```

**16)** Modify the given regular expression such that it gives the expected result.

```ruby
>>> ip = '( S:12 E:5 S:4 and E:123 ok S:100 & E:10 S:1 - E:2 S:42 E:43 )'

# wrong output
>>> re.findall(r'S:\d+.*?E:\d{2,}', ip)
['S:12 E:5 S:4 and E:123', 'S:100 & E:10', 'S:1 - E:2 S:42 E:43']

# expected output
##### add your solution here
['S:4 and E:123', 'S:100 & E:10', 'S:42 E:43']
```

>>> pat.sub('', s1)
'But Cool Te'
>>> pat.sub('', s2)
'it this .'
```

**2)** Delete from `start` if it is at the beginning of a line up to the next occurrence of the `end` at the end of a line. Match these markers case insensitively.

```ruby
>>> para = '''\
... good start
... start working on that
... project you always wanted
... to, do not let it end

# Unicode

**1)** Output `True` or `False` depending on input string made up of ASCII characters or not. Consider the input to be non-empty strings and any character that isn't part of 7-bit ASCII set should give `False`. Do you need regular expressions for this?

```ruby
>>> str1 = '123—456'
>>> str2 = 'good fοοd'
>>> str3 = 'happy learning!'
>>> str4 = 'İıſK'
>>> str5 = 'àpple'

##### add your solution here for str1
False
##### add your solution here for str2
False
##### add your solution here for str3
True
##### add your solution here for str4
False
##### add your solution here for str5
False
```

**2)** Does the `.` quantifier match non-ASCII characters even with the `re.ASCII` flag enabled?

**3)** Explore the following stackoverflow Q&A threads.

* [Remove powered number from string](https://stackoverflow.com/q/57553721/4082052)
* [Regular expression for French characters](https://stackoverflow.com/q/1922097/4082052)

# regex module

**1)** List the two `regex` module constants that affect the compatibility with the `re` module. Also specify their corresponding inline flags.

**2)** Replace sequences made up of words separated by `:` or `.` by the first word of the sequence and the separator. Such sequences will end when `:` or `.` is not followed by a word character.

```ruby
>>> ip = 'wow:Good:2_two.five: hi-2 bye kite.777:water.'

##### add your solution here
'wow: hi-2 bye kite.'
```

**3)** The given list of strings has fields separated by the `:` character. Delete `:` and the last field if there is a digit character anywhere before the last field.

```ruby
>>> items = ['42:cat', 'twelve:a2b', 'we:be:he:0:a:b:bother', 'fig-42:cherry:']

##### add your solution here
['42', 'twelve:a2b', 'we:be:he:0:a:b', 'fig-42:cherry']
```

**4)** Extract all whole words unless they are preceded by `:` or `<=>` or `----` or `#`.

```ruby
>>> ip = '::very--at<=>row|in.a_b#b2c=>lion----east'

##### add your solution here
['at', 'in', 'a_b', 'lion']
```

**5)** The given input string has fields separated by the `:` character. Extract field contents only if the previous field contains a digit character.

```ruby
>>> ip = 'vast:a2b2:ride:in:awe:b2b:3list:end'

##### add your solution here
['ride', '3list', 'end']
```

**6)** The given input strings have fields separated by the `:` character. Assume that each string has a minimum of two fields and cannot have empty fields. Extract all fields, but stop if a field with a digit character is found.

```ruby
>>> row1 = 'vast:a2b2:ride:in:awe:b2b:3list:end'
>>> row2 = 'um:no:low:3e:s4w:seer'
>>> row3 = 'oh100:apple:banana:fig'
>>> row4 = 'Dragon:Unicorn:Wizard-Healer'

>>> pat.findall(row1)
['vast']
>>> pat.findall(row2)
['um', 'no', 'low']
>>> pat.findall(row3)
[]
>>> pat.findall(row4)
['Dragon', 'Unicorn', 'Wizard-Healer']
```

**7)** For the given input strings, extract `if` followed by any number of nested parentheses. Assume that there will be only one such pattern per input string.

```ruby
>>> ip1 = 'for (((i*3)+2)/6) if(3-(k*3+4)/12-(r+2/3)) while()'
>>> ip2 = 'if+while if(a(b)c(d(e(f)1)2)3) for(i=1)'

'if(3-(k*3+4)/12-(r+2/3))'
>>> pat.search(ip2)[0]
'if(a(b)c(d(e(f)1)2)3)'
```

**8)** Read about the `POSIX` flag from [https://pypi.org/project/regex/](https://pypi.org/project/regex/). Is the following code snippet showing the correct output?

```ruby
>>> words = 'plink incoming tint winter in caution sentient'

>>> change = regex.compile(r'int|in|ion|ing|inco|inter|ink', flags=regex.POSIX)

>>> change.sub('X', words)

**9)** Extract all whole words for the given input strings. However, based on the user input `ignore`, do not match words if they contain any character present in the `ignore` variable.

```ruby
>>> s1 = 'match after the last new_line character A2'
>>> s2 = 'and then you want to test'

>>> ignore = 'aty'
>>> pat = regex.compile()       ##### add your solution here
>>> pat.findall(s1)
['new_line', 'A2']
>>> pat.findall(s2)
[]

>>> ignore = 'esw'
# should be the same solution used above
>>> pat = regex.compile()       ##### add your solution here
>>> pat.findall(s1)
['match', 'A2']
>>> pat.findall(s2)
['and', 'you', 'to']
```

**10)** Retain only the punctuation characters for the given strings (generated from codepoints). Consider the characters defined by the Unicode set `\p{P}` as punctuations for this exercise.

```ruby
>>> s1 = ''.join(chr(c) for c in range(0, 0x80))
>>> s2 = ''.join(chr(c) for c in range(0x80, 0x100))
>>> s3 = ''.join(chr(c) for c in range(0x2600, 0x27ec))

>>> pat = regex.compile()       ##### add your solution here

>>> pat.sub('', s1)
'!"#%&\'()*,-./:;?@[\\]_{}'
>>> pat.sub('', s2)
'¡§«¶·»¿'
>>> pat.sub('', s3)
'❨❩❪❫❬❭❮❯❰❱❲❳❴❵⟅⟆⟦⟧⟨⟩⟪⟫'
```

**11)** For the given **markdown** file, replace all occurrences of the string `python` (irrespective of case) with the string `Python`. However, any match within code blocks that starts with the whole line ` ```python ` and ends with the whole line ` ``` ` shouldn't be replaced. Consider the input file to be small enough to fit memory requirements.

Refer to the [exercises folder](https://github.com/learnbyexample/py_regular_expressions/tree/master/exercises) for the files `sample.md` and `expected.md` required to solve this exercise.

```ruby
>>> ip_str = open('sample.md', 'r').read()
>>> pat = regex.compile()      ##### add your solution here
>>> with open('sample_mod.md', 'w') as op_file:
...     ##### add your solution here
... 
305
>>> assert open('sample_mod.md').read() == open('expected.md').read()
```

**12)** For the given input strings, construct a word that is made up of the last characters of all the words in the input. Use the last character of the last word as the first character, last character of the last but one word as the second character and so on.

```ruby
>>> s1 = 'knack tic pi roar what'
>>> s2 = ':42;rod;t2t2;car--'

>>> pat = regex.compile()       ##### add your solution here

##### add your solution here for s1
'trick'
##### add your solution here for s2
'r2d2'
```

**13)** Replicate `str.rpartition()` functionality with regular expressions. Split into three parts based on the last match of sequences of digits, which is `777` and `12` for the given input strings.

```ruby
>>> s1 = 'Sample123string42with777numbers'
>>> s2 = '12apples'

>>> pat = regex.compile()       ##### add your solution here

>>> pat.split(s1)
['Sample123string42with', '777', 'numbers']
>>> pat.split(s2)
['', '12', 'apples']
```

**14)** Read about fuzzy matching from [https://pypi.org/project/regex/](https://pypi.org/project/regex/). For the given input strings, return `True` if they are exactly the same as `cat` or there is exactly one character difference. Ignore case differences. For example, `Ca2` should give `True`. `act` will be `False` even though the characters are same because position should also be considered.

```ruby
>>> pat = regex.compile()       ##### add your solution here

>>> bool(pat.fullmatch('CaT'))
True
>>> bool(pat.fullmatch('scat'))
False
>>> bool(pat.fullmatch('ca.'))
True
>>> bool(pat.fullmatch('ca#'))
True
>>> bool(pat.fullmatch('c#t'))
True
>>> bool(pat.fullmatch('at'))
False
>>> bool(pat.fullmatch('act'))
False
>>> bool(pat.fullmatch('2a1'))
False
```

**15)** The given input strings have fields separated by the `:` character. Extract all fields only after a field containing a digit character is found. Assume that each string has a minimum of two fields and cannot have empty fields.

```ruby
>>> row1 = 'vast:a2b2:ride:in:awe:b2b:3list:end'
>>> row2 = 'um:no:low:3e:s4w:seer'
>>> row3 = 'oh100:apple:banana:fig'
>>> row4 = 'Dragon:Unicorn:Wizard-Healer'

>>> pat = regex.compile()       ##### add your solution here

>>> pat.findall(row1)
['ride', 'in', 'awe', 'b2b', '3list', 'end']
>>> pat.findall(row2)
['s4w', 'seer']
>>> pat.findall(row3)
['apple', 'banana', 'fig']
>>> pat.findall(row4)
[]
```
