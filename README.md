The book also includes exercises to test your understanding, which are presented together as a single file in this repo — [Exercises.md](./exercises/Exercises.md).

You can also use [this interactive TUI app](https://github.com/learnbyexample/TUI-apps/tree/main/PyRegexExercises) to practice most of the exercises from the book.
